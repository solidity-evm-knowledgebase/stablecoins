#### Pegged Stablecoins

#### Floating Stablecoins

### Stability Method

Mechanism that keeps the coin stable, it revolves around minting and burning the stablecoins.

#### Governed

Centralized body that controls the minting and burning of the coins (governments, organizations...)

#### Algorithmic

Governed by a permissionless algorithm with no human intervention, a set of autonomous code dictates the minting/burning.

### Collateral Type

How the stablecoin is backed (what is giving it value)

USDT -->  US Dollars

DAI --> Backed by ETH...

#### Endogenous

If the stablecoin fails, the underlying collateral also fails.

Endogenous collateral originates from inside the protocol

Example: UST (Luna)

#### Exogenous

If the stablecoin fails, the underlying collateral survives.

Exogenous collateral originates from inside the protocol

Example: USDC, DAI
